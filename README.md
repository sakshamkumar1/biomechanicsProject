The code written in Python utilizes curve-fitting technique to plot the graphs of speed vs time and acceleration vs time for the thigh bone of a patient. It takes the file data.txt as an input which contains the values of x, y and z coordinates of the thigh at different time instants and utilizes it for getting the graphs of speeds and accelerations with time.
